# Numpy_Neural_Networks
* Single Hidden Layer:
  * Implementation of a single hidden layer neural network with little to no optimization algorithms. Mainly used for reference and clarification of the essentials.
* Deep:
  * Implementation of a deep neural network with most if not all optimization algorithms I learn. Currently in development.
